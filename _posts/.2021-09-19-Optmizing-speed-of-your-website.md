Fist user a tool by Google `Lighthouse` to run some tests against your website. Test provides a lot of insight into performance, and areas of improvement interms of speed, accessbility, best practices etc

1) Check if the response was that your browser received was compressed network Chrome dev tools
https://web.dev/uses-text-compression/?utm_source=lighthouse&utm_medium=devtools#check-if-a-response-was-compressed-in-chrome-devtools

Check the content-encoding header in the Response Headers section.

Your server should return the Content-Encoding HTTP response header to indicate what compression algorithm it used.
Content-Encoding: br
Use GZIP as a fallback to Brotli. GZIP is supported in all major browsers, but is less efficient than Brotli. See Server Configs for examples. (Brotli is the most efficient one)

If the browser supports Brotli (br) you should use Brotli because it can reduce the file size of the resources more than the other compression algorithms. Search for how to enable Brotli compression in <X>, where <X> is the name of your server. 

TODO: add instruction on how you can enable Brotli compression on Nginx server

If you are on cloudflare, then enable Auto minify for the following
- js
- css
- html
