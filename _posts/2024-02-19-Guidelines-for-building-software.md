### Guidelines for Building Software (In no perticular order)

At Our company, We try to follow the [12 principles of the Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html). In addition to them:

- **Do not lose customer data:** Anything input/sent by the customer should be treated with utmost care. Reconsider any operation that might violate this for any period of time. Consider data security.
- **“How is it going to be used?”** Ask this in as many places as possible.
- **Own things, be proactive:** Work with people who do the same. If something can be better, do it yourself, and push others to do the same.
- **Avoid knowledge silos** Achieve consensus on every decision in the team.
- **Build publicly:** Let everyone know publicly what you’re doing, how you’re doing it, and why. Praise publicly, criticize privately.
- **Think through a solution:** Planning is 80%, translating into code is 20%. Get solutions reviewed first.
- **Build for your future self:** Leave the codebase in a better place than how you found it. Make things uniform. If it can’t be debugged easily, don’t build it.
- **Build for the right customer:** Speak to & understand end-users as well as you would the code.
- **Build small things:** Break down larger tasks. Track progress. Question slowdowns and blockers.
- **Release weekly:** Continuous and incremental. Use feature toggles. 
- **Build for failure:** Every happy path is just one of dozens of failure scenarios.
- **Write tests:** Not too many. Mostly integration.
- **Automate manual tasks:** Document if you can’t automate. Comment if you can’t document.
- **Prevent people from making mistakes:** Both end-users and engineers.
- **Don’t be blocked:** Ask someone when stuck for > 20 minutes. No judgment.
- **Everything is your product:** Code, services, UI, colleagues, customers.


Happy learning!
